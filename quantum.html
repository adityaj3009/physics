            <p class="head-p">Quantum Mechanics is a branch of physics dealing with the behaviour of matter and energy 
                on the microscope scale of atoms and subatomic particles. Quantum mechanics is fundamental to our 
                understanding of all the fundamental forces of nature except gravity.

            <p>The motion of particles which can be observed directly or through microscope can be explained by classical 
                mechanics. But when the phenomena like photoelectric effect, X-rays, ultraviolet catastrophe, 
                superconductivity were discovered, classical physics failed to explain such phenomena. 
                The microworld of atoms obeys different laws. The new laws applicable for microparticles
            constitute quantum mechanics. The revision of classical concepts began with the seminal hypothesis of 
            Planck and many distinguished physicists such as Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrodinger, Born, Pauli,
             Heisenberg, Dirac and others contributed to the develop-ment of quantum mechanics.

            <p class="head-p">
                In nature energy can be transmitted either in the form of radiation (wave) or in the form of particle (matter).
                 If nature is symmetric then like radiation particle should exhibit wave like behaviour.
                  On this basis De broglie's stated that “particle can exhibit wave like behaviour and the wavelength (λ) of the particle having momentum P is λ = h/p”
	             The wave associated is termed as matter wave and the wavelength associated with it is termed as De broglie's wavelength.

            <h1>Postulates of quantisation of angular momentum.</h1>
            <p class="head-p">According to Bohr's second postulate electron will revolve only in those permissible orbits for 
                which angular momentum is equal to integral multiple of h/2π According to De broglie's when in hydrogen atom revolves around the nucleus then there are two possibilities.<br>
              Case 1 : Electron travels in the form of wave of wavelength along the nucleus at the closure if the two waves are out of phase (crest on trough and trough on crest), it will cause destructive interference due to which wave will be lost but this is not observed.<br>
              Case 2 : If at the closure the two waves are in phase (crest on crest and trough on trough) will give rise to constructive interference. Since, two waves are traveling in the opposite directions and hence will not constitute flow of energy hence give rise to concept of stationary orbits.
                        The total distance traveled by electron is 2πr.

             <h1 class="acme-regular">Davisson and Germer Experiment on Electron Diffraction</h1>
             <p class="head-p">If material particle has a wave character, it is expected to show phenomena like interference and diffraction. 
                In 1927, Davisson and Germer demonstrated that a beam of electrons does suffer diffraction. Their apparatus is shown in Fig.1.
                 Electrons from a heated filament are accelerated through a variable potential V and emerge from the 'electron gun' G.
                  This electron beam falls normally on a nickel crystal C. The electrons are diffracted from the crystal in all directions. 
                  The intensity of the diffracted beam in different directions is measured by a Faraday cylinder F (connected to a galvanometer), 
                  which can be moved along a circular scale S. The crystal can be turned about an axis parallel to the incident beam. 
                  Thus, any azimuth of the crystal can be presented to the plane defined by the incident beam and the beam entering the 
                  Faraday cylinder.<br>
                  First of all, the accelerating potential V is given a low value and the crystal is turned at any arbitrary azimuth. 
                  The Faraday cylinder is moved to various positions on the scale S and the galvanometer current at each position is noted. 
                  The current, which is a measure of the intensity of the diffracted beam, is plotted against the angle § between the incident beam,
                   and the beam entering the cylinder. The observations are repeated for different accelerating potentials and the corresponding curves 
                   are drawn as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
                   It is seen that a 'bump' begins to appear in the curve for 44-volt electrons. With increasing potential,
                    the bump moves upwards and becomes most prominent in the curve for 54-volt electrons at ϕ = 50°. At higher potentials the bump gradually disappears.
                   The bump in its most prominent state verifies the existence of electron waves. For, according to de Broglie,
                    the wavelength associated with an electron accelerated through V volts is

                    Hence, the wavelength associated with a 54-volt electron is λ = 1.67<h>&#8491;</h>

                    Now, it is known from X-ray analysis that the nickel crystal acts as a plane diffraction grating with grating space = d = 0.91 Å 
                    (Figure 3). According to experi¬ment, we have a diffracted electron beam at θ  = 50°. This arises from wave-like diffraction from 
                    the family of Bragg atomic planes. The corresponding angle of incidence relative to the family of Bragg planes is 
                    <h>θ = 65° =</h>

                      <br>
                      This being in excellent agreement with the wavelength computed from de Bro¬glie hypothesis, shows that electrons are wave-like in some 
                      circumstances. Other fundamental particles like neutrons also show wave-like properties. The Davisson-Germer experiment thus provides 
                      direct verification of de Broglie hypothesis of the wave nature of moving particles.

             <h1 class="acme-regular">Properties of Matter Waves</h1>
            <p class="head-p">
                <b>Following are the properties of Matter Wave:</b><br>
                1) 	Lighter is the particle, greater is the wavelength associated with it.<br> 
	            2) 	Smaller is the velocity of the particle, greater is the wavelength associated with it.<br>
	            3) 	When v = 0 then λ =  ∞, i.e., wave becomes indeterminate and if v =  ∞ then λ = 0. This shows that matter waves are generated 
                by the motion of particles. These waves are produced whether the particles are charged particles or they are uncharged (λ =h/p is independent of charge). 
                This fact reveals that these waves are not electromagnetic waves but they are a new kind of waves (electromagnetic waves are produced only by motion of charged particles).<br>
	            4) 	The velocity of matter waves depends on the velocity of material particle, i.e., it is not a constant while the velocity of electromagnetic wave is constant.<br>
	            5) 	The velocity of matter waves is greater than the velocity of light. This can be proved as under :
		        We know that E = hf and E = mc<sup>2</sup><br>
                <h>&#8756;</h>
		        hf = mc<sup>2</sup> 
                <br>
                The wave velocity (ω) is given by:<br>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                    <mrow>

                        <msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup>

                  </math>
                  <br>
                  As particle velocity v cannot exceed c (velocity of light), hence ω is greater than the velocity of light.<br>
	            6)	The wave and particle aspects of moving bodies can never appear together in the same experiment.
                 When we can say is that waves have particle-like proper¬ties and particles have wave-like properties and the 
                 concepts are inseparably linked. Matter wave representation is only a symbolic representation.<br>
	            7)	The wave nature of matter introduces an uncertainty in the location of the position of the particle because a wave cannot
                 be said exactly at this point or exactly at that point. However, where the wave is large (strong), there is a good chance of 
                 finding the particle while, where the wave is small (weak) there is very small chance of finding the particle.

                <b style="margin-bottom: 0;">Q.1 What is wave function?</b>
                <p class="wave-para" style="margin-top: 0;">Waves represent the propagation of a disturbance in a medium. Light waves are represented by electromagnetic field
                  variations, and sound waves are represented by pressure variations.<br>
                1)The de Broglie wave associated with a moving particle cannot be specified in a similar manner. Since electrons have
                 wave properties, it may be assumed that a quantity &psi; represents a de Broglie wave, just as the electric vector represents 
                 a light wave. This quantity &psi; is called the wave function.<br>
                 2) &psi; (x, y, z, t) is a function of space and time coordinates, representing the position of a particle at some time t.<br>
                 3)However, it is not possible to locate a particle precisely at position (x, y, z); there is only a probability of the 
                 particle being at the specific point (x, y, z). The wave function &psi; is usually a complex quantity.<br>
                </p>
                <hr style="color: black; width: 80%;">
                 <b>Q.2	What is the physical interpretation of Wave Function?</b>
                 <p class="wave-para">
                    The first and the simple interpretation of &psi; was given by Schrödinger himself in terms of charge density.<br>
                    1. We know that in any electromagnetic wave system if A is the amplitude of the wave, then the energy density, i.e., energy per unit volume is equal to A<sup>2</sup>, so that the number of photons per unit volume, i.e., photon density is equal to A<sup>2</sup>/h&gamma; or the photon density is proportional to A<sup>2</sup> as h&gamma; is constant.<br>
                    2. If &psi; is the amplitude of matter waves at any point in space, then the particle density at that point may be taken as proportional to &psi;<sup>2</sup>.<br>
                    3. Thus, &psi;<sup>2</sup> is a measure of particle density. When this is multiplied by the charge of the particle, the charge density is obtained.<br>
                    4. In this way, &psi;<sup>2</sup> is a measure of charge density.<br>
                    5. It is observed that in some cases, &psi; is appreciably different from zero within some finite region known as a wave packet. It is natural to ask, "where is the particle in relation to the wave packet?"<br>
                    6. To explain it, Max Born suggested a new idea about the physical significance of &psi; which is generally accepted nowadays.<br>
                    7. According to Max Born, &psi;&psi;* = |&psi;|<sup>2</sup> gives the probability of finding the particle in the state &psi;, i.e., &psi;<sup>2</sup> is a measure of probability density.<br>
                    8. The probability of finding a particle in volume d&tau; = dx dy dz is given by<br> |&psi;|<sup>2</sup> dx dy dz.<br>
                    9. For the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is, of course, unit, i.e., the particle is certainly to be found somewhere in space.
                    <br>∭ |&psi;|<sup>2</sup> dx dy dz
                    = 1 &psi; satisfying the above requirement is said to be normalized.
                </p>   
                <hr style="color: black; width: 80%;">
                <b style="margin-bottom: 0;">Q.3   Explain normalization of wave function.</b><br>
                <p class="wave-para" style="margin-top: 0;">
                    1)We define probability density function (probability distribution function) as 
                    P(x, t)dx =	&psi;(x, t) . &psi;(x, t) dx <br>
                    2)It is an interpretation about the wave which arises due to an e<sup>-</sup> lying between finite interval 
                    bounded by x<sub>1</sub> and  x<sub>2</sub> i.e. we are sure to find the particle within confined limits lying 
                    between x(x<sub>1</sub>) and (x + dx)(x<sub>2</sub>)
                     i.e. maximum probability to find the particle lying between -∞ and +∞ is 1.<br>
                    3) If at all the particle exists, the particle is certainly somewhere in the universe therefore, the probability of 
                    finding the particle somewhere in the universe must be unity. <br>
                    4)Since the probability of its being located in an elemental volume is proportional to |&psi;|<sup>2</sup> dx dy dz, it is convenient 
                    to choose the constant of proportionality such that the sum of the probabilities over all values of x, y, z must be unity. <br>
                    5)This is called the normalization condition. A wave function satisfying the above condition is said to be normalized.

                <p style="margin-top: 0;">In classical mechanics, we describe a particle occupying a definite place in space and a specific momentum. 
                    At a given instant of time, one can evaluate position and momentum simultaneously. This may appear valid only under the 
                    boundary of classical mechanics. When one steps out of classical mechanics and enters the wave mechanics 
                    (available at atomic scale) this idea is no more valid.<br>
                    Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that quantum mechanics does not simultaneously permit the determination of
                    position and momentum of a particle accurately. Any effort made ot make the measurement of position of the particle 
                    such as an electron very accurately, results in a large uncertainty in the measurement of momentum and vice versa. <br>

                     1)The physical significance of the above argument is that one should not think of the exact position or an
                      accurate value for momentum of a particle. Instead, one should think of the probability of finding the particle 
                      at a certain position, or of the probable value for the momentum of the particle. <br>
                     2)The estimation of such probabilities are made by means of certain mathematical functions, named probability 
                     density functions in quantum mechanics.<br>

                      1)HUP has nothing to do with instrument used for the measurement of the given quantity as its limits are set by nature 
                      i.e. an ideal instrument will provide an error for the product,<br>

                <br>
                      2) HUP imposes no limitations on precision with which the position or momentum is measured. But restriction 
                      involved is that if one measures the displacement precisely then greater is uncertainty one introduces into 
                      simultaneous measurement of momentum or otherwise i.e., if p is known exactly then  nothing is known about x <br> 
                      i.e. Δp = 0, then Δx = ∞.<br>
                      3) Since   is very very small quantity, HUP has no practical significance in ordinary macroscopic situations where
                       measured quantities are large.

        <h><b>Electron Diffraction Experiment</b></h>
        <b>Q.3	How can Heisenberg's Principle be proved by electron diffraction experiment?</b>
        <p>
            Let us consider a stream of electrons moving along x direction passes through a narrow slit of width d (= Δy).
             If Δy is comparable to the wavelength of the electron beam, then the electrons will diffract according to single slit
              diffraction pattern and form a central maximum and two secondary minimum. According to diffraction theory,<br>
              d sinθ = λ<br>
              d = Δy = uncertainty in position of electron before being diffracted.<br>
              Before diffraction a slit electron has momentum px only along x direction and zero in y direction. Therefore, uncertainty of y component of momentum of  Δp<sub>y</sub> = 0. Because of the diffraction effect at the slit, the particle acquires a small component of momentum py in y direction. The original momentum of the particle in the X direction p<sub>x</sub>decreases so that the resultant momentum p remains constant. The original momentum of the particle in the y direction was accurately known to be zero. Therefore,  Δp<sub>y</sub> is the uncertainty introduced in the y component of the momentum.
	          Δp<sub>y</sub> is the uncertainty produced in y component of momentum. <br>
              Particles that strike the screen at a point A the first minima, must have left the slit at an angle θ, given by<br>

                1)Louis de Broglie put forward the dual behaviour in terms of hypothesis which states 
                “If the radiation behaves as particle under certain circumstances and wave under other circumstances, 
                then one can even expect that, entities which ordinarily behave as particles to exhibit properties attributed to only waves 
                under appropriate circumstances”.<br>
                2)Electromagnetic waves always travel with a constant velocity c, whereas matter waves may travel with that phase velocity 
                which depends upon mass and velocity of particle.<br>
                3)It was predicted that if a suitable voltage is considered then a wavelength of the order of few Å which is of the order of 
                interplanar spacing in the crystal can be 	obtained. <br>
                4)Experimental value which is obtained by considering electron as wave is verified with theoretical value. This confirms de 
                Broglie's hypothesis.<br>
                5)It is important to know that wave function &psi; has no direct physical significance but |&psi;|<sup>2</sup> has.<br>
                6)Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that quantum mechanics does not simultaneously permit the determination of
                 position and momentum of a particle accurately.<br>
                7)The KE of electron must be greater than 19 MeV if it is to remain inside the nucleus. This is practically not possible 
                (atom becomes unstable) hence one can say that electron cannot survive inside the nucleus.<br>
                8)Based on de-Broglie's idea of matter waves, Schrodinger developed a mathematical theory which plays the same role as
                 Newton's laws in classical mechanics.
