                <b>Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation</b>: <br>The light emitted from a conventional light source (like sodium lamp) is said to 
                  be in-coherent because the radiation emitted from different atoms do not, in general, bear any definite phase relationship with each other. 
                  On the other hand, the light emitted from a laser has a very high degree of coherence and is almost parallel.<br>
                  According to Bohr's postulate, in atom model, if an atom at higher energy state E<sub>2</sub> moves to lower energy state E<sub>1</sub>, it will release the quantum of energy hv given by,<br>
                  E<sub>2</sub> - E<sub>1</sub> = hv<br>
                  where v is the frequency of radiated energy and h is the Plank's constant. This is downward transmission. Conversely, 
                  if a quantum of energy hv is incident on an atom at lower state E<sub>1</sub> it will absorb the energy and will move to higher energy state E<sub>2</sub>.<br>
                  Thus electromagnetic radiation can interact with atomic energy levels in three ways.

                A laser is a remarkable device that generates a concentrated beam of light through a process known as stimulated emission.
                 By stimulating atoms or molecules to release photons in a coordinated manner, lasers produce a coherent and monochromatic 
                 light source. This focused beam is utilized across a multitude of applications, ranging from precision cutting and welding 
                 in manufacturing to medical procedures like laser surgery and diagnostics. Its versatility and unique properties make the laser 
                 a pivotal tool in modern technology, enabling advancements in communication, research, industry, and healthcare.

                   <b>Q. What does the word LASER stand for? Explain the following terms 
                    related to LASER with appropriate figures: (i) Absorption, 
                    (ii) Spontaneous emission, (iii) Stimulated emission </b><br>
                    Ans: Laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation<br>
                    1) <b>Absorption</b>:<br>An atom in the ground state may absorb a photon of appropriate 
                    energy and get raised to an excited state. This is called induced absorption.<br>
                    a) In non-coherent and non-monochromatic radiation, atoms transition randomly from higher energy states to lower ones, 
                    emitting energy of varying frequencies, phases, and amplitudes.<br>
                    b) Monochromatic but non-coherent radiation occurs when all atoms transition from E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub> due to incident radiation,
                     emitting energy with the same frequency but different phases due to the asynchronous nature of transitions.<br>
                    c) Coherent and monochromatic radiation happens when all atoms are initially at E<sub>2</sub> and transition synchronously to E<sub>1</sub>,
                     resulting in energy emission with the same frequency, wavelength, and phase.<br>
                     2)<b>Spontaneous emission</b>:<br>
                     a) An atom in an excited state may give up energy and fall back to the ground state. 
                     This process is called spontaneous emission.<br>
                      b) An atom raised to its excited state does not stay there for a longer time because the excited state is inherently unstable.<br>
                    c) Exited atoms rapidly de-excite due to the natural tendency of atoms to seek the lowest energy state. This type of process in which, 
                    atom on its own releases a photon is called as spontaneous emission.<br>
                    d) The spontaneous emission events are completely probabilistic; 
                    meaning there is no control to which and how many atoms will de-excite at a given time and which energy levels are involved.<br>
                    e) Therefore spontaneously emitted light is incoherent, divergent, diffused and undirected. It may or may not be monochromatic. Light 
                    from ordinary sources (e.g. bulb, tube light, LED, Na-light, candle,burner, etc.) is a result of spontaneous emission.<br>
                    3)<b>Stimulated emission</b>:<br>
                    a) This type of process also exists along with the above two processes but at 
                    room temperature, spontaneous emission dominates stimulated emission and 
                    the latter is generally negligible.<br>
                    b) The idea behind stimulated emission is that the process of emission need not 
                    be probabilistic, we can induce some transition to occur.<br>
                    c) A photon of energy hv = E<sub>2</sub> - E<sub>1</sub> or greater can induce the excited atom to de-excite by imparting some momentum to release energy in the form of 
                    another photon.<br>
                    d) The released photon is identical to the incident photon in every respect. This 
                    is called stimulated emission.<br>
                    <br>

                    Q. <b>What are the advantages of stimulated emission over spontaneous emission.</b>
                    (1) The process is controllable from outside.<br>
                    (2) The induced radiation is identical to the incident radiation in every respect: 
                    energy, frequency or wavelength, phase, state of polarization, direction of 
                    propagation, etc.<br>
                    (3) By selecting proper active medium and resonance conditions, multiplication 
                    of photons is achieved in something called as optical resonating cavity. This 
                    process is called light amplification.<br>
                    (4) As a result, we get a highly monochromatic, coherent, directional, focused 
                    and intense radiation called as laser light.<br>

                <p class="head-p">
                   Q. <b>Explain the term Metastable state.</b><br>
                   1) The atoms are energized to a higher energy level by absorbing energy from external sources like optical, electrical, etc.
                    They remain in an excited state for a very short period of 10<sup>-8</sup>second; after that, they spontaneously release their excess energy.<br>
                   2) For stimulated emission to occur, the atoms should remain excited long enough, typically for 10<sup>-4</sup>s, as atoms are
                    continuously lifted up to the excited state by pumping and a number of them rapidly undergo spontaneous transition to the lower level. 
                    Therefore, the state of Population Inversion (PI) is difficult to be achieved. <br>
                    3) To achieve that state (PI), the excited atoms should remain in the uppermost level till the condition N<sub>2</sub> > N<sub>2</sub> gets satisfied.<br> 
                    4) So a metastable state is such a long-lived upper energy level from where the excited atoms do not return to the lower level instantly.<br>
                    5) In the metastable state, the excited atoms remain for an appreciable time for 10<sup>-6</sup>s to 10<sup>-3</sup>s,
                     which is a very long time for an atom in the excited state to create a state of population inversion. <br>
                    6)The population of atoms in the metastable stateis greater than that in the lower state, which leads to population inversion.<br>

                <p class="head-p">
                   Q. <b>Explain the term Population Inversion. </b><br>
                   1) The life time of an atom in an excited state is at the order of 10<sup>-8</sup>sec.So before an excited atom can be 
                   stimulated to emit a photon, it is likely to make a spontaneous emission and the photons emitted by spontaneous emission are not coherent.<br>
                   2) For atomic radiation, W is usually much greater than KT. Hence at thermal equilibrium the population of high states is much smaller than that of the ground state.<br>
                   3) Suppose radiation of appropriate energy is incident on a mixture of excited and unexcited atoms. The probability of induced absorption by an 
                   unexcited atom is exactly the same as that of stimulated emission by excited atom. The population of unexcited atom is much larger than 
                   that of excited atoms. The life time of excited atom is much short. For these two reasons most of the photons of the incident radiation 
                   cause induced absorption. There will be very few stimulated emissions.<br>
                   4) A solution to the above problem can be found in an atom which has three energy levels as shown. The atoms that are 
                   originally in the ground state G are raised to the higher excited state S by an external agency. This excited state is 
                   short lived. The atoms cannot remains in the state S for long.<br>
                   5) They rapidly decay into an intermediate state M called metastable state. The above process of transfer in a atoms 
                   from the ground state to the metastable state is called optical pumping. The life time of an atom in the metastable state is of the order of
                    10<sup>-3</sup>s which is much greater than the life till in the excited state S which is at the order of 10<sup>-8</sup>sec. <br>
                   A passing  photon produce lasing transition from M to the ground state. The above  process in which the ratio of the population in a higher state M to that in  
                   the ground state is increased considerably is called population inversion.

                <p class="head-p">
                    Q. <b>What is pumping in LASER? Give the types of pumping.</b><br>
                    There are many techniques for pumping a collection of atoms to an 
                    inverted state. Most commonly used are optical pumping, electrical 
                    discharge and direct conversion. In optical pumping a light source, such 
                    as a gaseous discharge flash tube is used. This method is used in solid 
                    state lasers. In electric discharge method, the electric field causes 
                    ionization of the medium and raises it to the excited state. This method is 
                    used in gas lasers. A direct conversion of electric energy into light takes 
                    place in semiconductor laser.<br>
                    In the three level pumping schemes, the pumping is done with a broad band intense light source, like a xenon flash lamp. Initially, the population of atomic 
                    states obeys Boltzmann's Law as 
                    shown in <b>Figure A </b>and the 
                    optical transition between the 
                    energy states E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub> and the 
                    ground state are absorptive. 
                    Subsequently, excited atoms 
                    undergo spontaneous transitions 
                    from higher to lower levels.<br> 
                    Transitions 2 → 1, 2 → 0, 1 → 0 
                    are all possible but the 
                    probabilities of different transition 
                    are such that<br> P<sub>21</sub> > P<sub>20</sub> > P<sub>10</sub>. 
                    It means that atoms leave the state E<sub>2</sub> quickly but stay for longer time in state 
                    E<sub>1</sub> and accumulate. Therefore, the state E<sub>1</sub> is called a metastable state and it 
                    may be considered that the atoms get trapped therefore sufficiently longer 
                    time.<br> As a result, the population of E<sub>1</sub> exceeds that of E<sub>0</sub> and population 
                    inversion is obtained. Ruby laser makes use of three level pumping scheme.<br>
                    Three level pumping generally requires very high pumping power 
                    because the terminal state of laser transition is the ground state and 
                    more than hay of the ground state atoms must be pumped to the upper 
                    state to achieve population inversion.<br> A four level pumping scheme is 
                    characterized by greatly reduced pumping requirements. As shown in 
                    <b>Figure B</b> pump excitation lifts atoms from the ground state to the highest 
                    state of the four levels involved in the process. From this level atoms 
                    decay to the metastable state E<sub>2</sub> and the population of this state grows 
                    rapidly.<br> If the life time of the 3 → 2 and 1 → 0 transitions are short and 
                    that of 2 → 1 transition can be achieved and maintained with moderate 
                    pumping. The population of energy levels E<sub>3</sub> and E<sub>1</sub> remain essentially 
                    unchanged with the onset of pumping and only a small number of atoms need to be added to the population of energy level E<sub>2</sub> to make N<sub>2</sub> greater 
                    than N<sub>1</sub>.

                <p class="head-p">
                  Q. <b>Explain Resonance Cavity in working of LASER.</b>  <br>
                  In the initial stages of lasing process in a medium, spontaneous photons 
                  are emitted in every direction as are the concomitant Stimulated photons. 
                  It is imperative that photons with a specific direction are selected while 
                  others are rejected. Secondly, if stimulated photons pass through the 
                  medium only once the resultant amplification of light would be too low. 
                  The intensity of the beam can be increased and directional selectivity can 
                  be achieved by placing two reflecting mirrors at the two ends of the medium. The mirrors direct the photons back and forth through the 
                  medium many times as illustrated in <b>Figure</b>.<br>
                  With such an arrangement the effective length of the amplifying medium 
                  becomes many lenses the actual length of laser and the photons spend 
                  enough time in the medium to de-excite as many atoms as possible. Thus 
                  increasing the intensity of the beam. In effect, the mirrors feedback the 
                  emitted radiation into the medium, till it acts as an oscillator capable of 
                  supplying sustained light output. One of the mirrors is in fact, partially 
                  transmitting and as the laser beam builds up to enough intensity, it 
                  emerges out of the system as an intense beam. The photons emitted in 
                  directions other than that parallel to the axis of the laser quickly pass out 
                  of the system. In contrast the axial beam continues to build up as it 
                  bounces back and forth across the active medium. This accounts for the 
                  amazing degree of collimation of the emerging laser beam. The system of 
                  two mirrors enclosing the active medium constitutes the optical resonant 
                  cavity. It is the optical feedback provided by cavity mirrors that converts 
                  the whole assembly into an oscillator and hence into a light generator. 
                  The radiative transitions invariably result in a broad range of frequency 
                  out of these broad range the cavity select and amplify only certain narrow 
                  bands and if desired only one such band. This is the reason for the 
                  external monochromaticity of laser beams.

                <p class="head-p">
                   Q. <b> Why x-ray and Laser are so powerful than ordinary visible light.</b><br>
                   Ans:  Laser light differs greatly from that given out by conventional sources. 
                   The most striking features of laser radiation are :<br>
                   (a) <b>High monochromaticity </b>:  The light emitted by a laser is much more 
                   monochromatic than that of any conventional monochromatic source. 
                   Because of various broadening mechanisms the light emitted by 
                   electron transition between the same two energy levels of different 
                   atoms in the source is never confined to a single frequency but is 
                   spread over a continuous frequency range. In the case of lasers the 
                   optical resonator formed by the two mirrors sustains only the specific frequencies out of the broad band and converts the continuous 
                   emission band into a group of sharply defined discrete lines of which 
                   a few or even a single line can be selected out by some frequency selective medium.<br>

                   (b) <b>High degree of coherence</b>: Laser light is characterized by a very high degree of 
                   coherence. This is inherent in the processes of stimulated emission which is responsible for laser action.<br>
                   
                   (c) <b>Directionality</b>:  A conventional light source emits light in all 
                   directions. Laser on the other hand emits light only in one direction. 
                   It is achieved by confirming the stimulating radiation to common axes 
                   of mirror pair. The width of laser beam is extremely narrow. Its size is 
                   determined by diffraction and the diameter of the active material. 
                   The divergence is expressed as θ = 1.22 λ/D radians where θ is the beam 
                   angle and D is the diameter of the active material.<br>
                   
                   (d) <b>High intensity</b>:Laser light is much more intense and brighter than that 
                   from any of the conventional sources. In fact, one milliwatt He-Ne 
                   laser appears brighter than the sun laser gives light into a narrow 
                   beam remains concentrated in small regions. As the divergence is 
                   very small, the energy remains confined to a narrow region even at long distances from the laser source.<br>

                <p class="head-p">
                  <b>Active Medium </b><br>
                  A medium in which light gets amplified is called active medium and this medium 
                  may be solid, liquid or a gas. It is important to note the only a small fraction of a 
                  particular medium is responsible to stimulated emission and the remaining part 
                  of the medium merely supports the active centres.<br>
                  <b>Population </b>: Number of active atoms occupying an energy state is known as the 
                  population of that state. 
                  Let N1 and N2 be the population of the lower (E1) and upper (E2) energy states 
                  respectively. At the thermal equilibrium, population of energy levels E2 and E1 are 
                  given by the Boltzmann's relation as :<br>
                  N<sub>2</sub> = N<sub>1</sub> e<sup>-(E<sub>2</sub>-E<sub>1</sub>)/kT</sup>  <br>
                  N<sub>1</sub> = N<sub>2</sub> e<sup>-(E<sub>2</sub>-E<sub>1</sub>)/kT</sup>   <br>
                  ∴ N<sub>1</sub> = N<sub>2</sub> e<sup>-(hv/kT)</sup>    ....(1) <br>
                  where negative exponent factor in equation (1) shows that N<sub>2</sub> << N<sub>1</sub>, at 
                  the equilibrium, which in other words mean that there are more 
                  atoms in the tower energy state E1 and this state is called Normal State.<br>
                  If an external radiation is incident on the medium under normal state condition, the three processes, viz., 
                  absorption, spontaneous emission and stimulated emission occur 
                  simultaneously as shown in figure.<br>
                  As is clear from the figure, atoms in the lower level E<sub>1</sub> will randomly absorb 
                  radiation to make a transition of E<sub>2</sub> level, which may again randomly give 
                  radiation and come to the lower level E<sub>1</sub>.

                <h1 class="acme-regular">Helium-Neon Laser</h1>
                <p class="head-p">
                    Q. <b>With neat energy level diagram describe the construction and working of He-Ne Laser. What are the merits and demerits?</b><br>
                    Ans: The most widely used type of gas laser is the Helium-Neon.
                    The electrical discharge is used as an efficient method of producing population 
                    inversion.<br>
                    <b>Construction</b>: He-Ne laser consists of a long and narrow discharge tube, of diameter of about 1 cm and about 80 cm long,
                     filled with about 10 part helium and 1 part of Neon. The electrodes are connected to high voltage source of about 4kV D.C.<br>
                     <b>Working</b>: The operation of a He-Ne laser involves passing a discharge through a gas mixture of helium and neon. 
                     Electrons in the discharge excite helium atoms to metastable levels F2 and F3, while some neon atoms are excited by 
                     collisions with helium atoms. This creates a population inversion between neon energy levels E<sub>4</sub> (or E<sub>4</sub>) and lower levels.
                      Emission occurs at wavelengths of 3.39 μm, 1.15 μm, and 6328 Å (corresponding to infrared and red light). Neon atoms in 
                      level E<sub>3</sub> emit a photon at around 6000 Å. Pressure is adjusted for efficient energy transfer from helium to neon. 
                      In a narrow tube, neon atoms in E<sub>2</sub> collide with walls, de-exciting to E<sub>1</sub>. Typical power outputs range from 1 to 50 mW 
                      continuous wave for inputs of 5<sup>-10</sup> W.<br>
                      <b>Advantages</b>:<br>
                      1)The light from gas lasers as compared to that from solid state lasers is 
                      found to be more directional and much more monochromatic.<br>
                      2) The gas lasers are also capable of supplying a continuous laser beam.
                      3)Highly stable.
                      4)No separate cooling system is required.<br>
                     <b>Disadvantages</b> :<br>
                      Low efficiency and low power output.<br>
                      <b>Role of He atoms</b>:<br>
                      1. Helium atoms being, lighter than neon atoms, absorb the energy 
                      from the high energy electrons easily and very fast.<br>
                      2. Helium atoms have longer lifetime than the neon atoms at the 
                      metastable states. Hence, the state of population inversion is 
                      maintained for a long time which makes the induction for 
                      stimulated emission easy.<br>
                      3. The ratio of He: Ne = 10:1 makes the probability of energy transfer 
                      for He atoms to Neon atoms much larger.<br>
                      4. Being a good conductor of heat, He acts as a coolant and no 
                      separate cooling system is required.<br>
                </p>

            <h1 class="acme-regular">ND : YAG Laser</h1>
            <p class="head-p"> 
                1)Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Y<sub>3</sub>A<sub>15</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) which is commonly called YAG is an 
                optically isotropic crystal. Some of the Y<sup>3</sup> ions in the crystal are replaced by 
                rare earth element Nd<sup>3+</sup> (neodymium) ions. They act as active centers.<br>
                2) Nd:YAG laser is one of the most popular solid state laser and is a four level 
                laser system. In Nd : YAG laser, crystal atoms do not participate in losing 
                action but act as host lattice in which Nd<sup>3+</sup> ions (active centers) are present.<br>
                <b>Pumping</b>:<br>
                Krypton flashlamp with wavelength 5000 A to 8000 A is used for pumping. An intense beam of white light
                 obtained from flashlamp is used to excite neodymium Ions.<br>
                <b>Resonance Cavity</b>: <br>
                It consists of an elliptically cylindrical reflector housing the laser rod along one of its focus line and flashlamp 
                along the other focus line. The light leaving one focus of the ellipse will pass through the other focus after reflection
                 from the silvered surface of the reflector. As a result, entire flashlamp radiation gets focused on the laser rod.
                  The YAG rod is 10 centimeter in length and 12 millimeter in diameter. 
                  The two ends of the rod are covered with partial and hundred percent reflecting mirror.<br>
                  <b>Working</b>:<br>
                  1) Nd:YAG is a four level laser system. The ground state Nd<sup>+3</sup>sup>are excited 
                  to a higher state by pumping.<br>
                  2)These excited ions go to upper levels E<sub>5</sub> and E<sub>4</sub> and quickly jump to 
                  the upper metastable state E<sub>3</sub> by releasing the excess energy to the 
                  crystal.<br>
                  3) The upper energy level E<sub>3</sub> will be rapidly populated as the excited 
                  Nd<sup>+3</sup> ions quickly make downward transition from the upper energy 
                  bands.<br>
                  4) The lower energy level E<sub>2</sub> cannot be populated by neodymium ions
                  due to thermal transition to the ground level.<br>
                  5) Thus, population inversion is achieved between E<sub>3</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> levels.
                  6)Photons generated move back and forth between the mirrors,
                  amplification takes place and finally laser emission occurs.
                  7)The Nd<sup>+3</sup> return to the ground state E<sub>1</sub> through non radiative 
                  transition.<br>
                  <b>Output</b>: <br>
                  Wavelength of 1.06 µm in the infrared region is obtained whose efficiency is low 
                  and the power output is moderate.<br>
                  <b>Function of ellipsoidal reflector</b>:<br>
                  1) In between the consecutive flashes of the Krypton lamp the Nd:YAG 
                  rod keeps on receiving light through multiple reflections on the 
                  elliptical reflector.<BR>
                  2) The laser beam is emitted continuously by Nd:YAG rod . Hence, 
                  Nd:YAG Laser works on the continuous wave mode.<br>
                  <b>Applications</b>: <br>
                  Nd:YAG laser finds applications in many machine operations like drilling, welding, 
                  etc. Also they are being used in medical surgery and many..<br>

            <h1 class="acme-regular">Semiconductor Laser</h1>
            <p class="head-p"> 
                <b>Principle</b>:<br>
                Semi-conductors are the materials having conductivity between the conductors 
                and insulators.  p-type semi-conductor and n-type semi-conductor form a 
                junction , where n type region consists of excess of electrons and p-type region 
                consists of excess of holes. So an electric field is created in the region resulting in 
                the formation of a depletion layer.<br>
                If now p-type semi-conductor is connected to the positive of a direct current 
                source and n-type semi-conductor is connected to the negative terminal, then 
                flow of electrons (from n-region) and flow of holes (from p-region) takes place. 
                These electrons and holes may recombine to produce radiation. This amounts to 
                shifting of an electron from conduction band to valence band. In case the 
                current is sufficiently large laser action may take place.
                <b><u>Components</u></b>:<br>
                The essential components of this laser source are as follows:<br>
                <b>Active Medium</b>: The depletion region of the diode act as the active medium, 
                which ideally should be free of charge carriers.<br>
                <b>Energy Source </b>: An electrical power supply is used as the energy source. In this 
                case the pumping is of direct conversion type.<br>
                <b>Resonance Cavity</b>: The two open sides of depletion region are polished to serve 
                as the partial and total reflectors . This serves as a resonator cavity with the 
                diode thickness equal to an integral multiple of λ/2.<br>
                <b>Population Inversion</b>: Population inversion means there must be a region of the 
                device in which large density of free electrons in the bottom energy level of 
                conduction band and large density of holes in the top energy levels of valence 
                band exists. This is achieved by high doping concentration.<br>
                <b>Working</b>:<br>
                A heavily doped P-type and N-type semiconductor form the basis of a laser diode. When forward biased,
                electrons and holes enter the depletion region. At low forward current, recombination of these carriers emits spontaneous,
                 incoherent photons, behaving like an LED. With increased forward bias, a population inversion occurs between energy levels 
                 Ec and Ev in the depletion region due to higher injection rates than recombination rates. Stimulated emission is triggered by
                 a spontaneous photon, causing coherent photon emission as electrons transition from Ec to Ev levels. The emitted radiation strengthens within the resonance cavity,
                producing a high-intensity laser beam. The wavelength of the laser depends on the bandgap energy (Eg) of the diode material, where Eg = hv. For example, GaAs emits infrared light at 8500 Å,
                while GaAsP diode lasers, operated at low temperatures, emit visible light at 6400 Å.<br>
                <b>Merits</b>:<br>
                 1) It is simple and compact. <br>
                2) It is highly efficient.<br>
                3) It requires very low power.<br>
                4) It is tunable that means the wavelength of emitted laser can be 
                regulated.<br>
                <b>Demerits</b>:<br>
                1) It is highly temperature sensitive.<br>
                <b>Applications of diode laser</b>:<br>
                They are used in-<br>
                1) Optical fiber communication as the light source<br>
                2)Satellite communication<br>
                3)Laser printer,CD players , optical floppy disks<br>

            <h1 class="acme-regular">Holography</h1>
            <p class="head-p">
                1) Holography is a method of entire recording or complete recording of 
                any object.<br>
                2) Based on the phenomenon of interference of light, it is a technique of 
                obtaining three-dimensional image of the object.<br>
                3) Ordinary photographs record the amplitude of the object whereas in 
                holography, both, the amplitude and phase of the wave is recorded.<br>
                4) These amplitude and phase are stored in the interference pattern, 
                which is formed between the object wave and reference wave.<br>
                5) Laser beam being highly coherent is used as incident source for 
                obtaining interference.<br>
                <b>Recordings</b>: <br>
                1)Light from a laser source splits into two beans beams:<br>
                2) One directly going to the object and then towards the photographic 
                plate called object beam.
                3)The other, after getting reflected from mirror goes to the photographic 
                plate and is called as reference beam.<br>
                4)At the photographic plate, an interference takes place between object 
                wave and the reference wave.<br>
                5) On the surface of photographic plate, detailed information related to 
                the object is stored in the form of interference pattern.<br>
                6) After developing the photographic plate, it is called as hologram.<br>
                7) A hologram does not contain a distinct image of the object. The 
                interference pattern on a hologram consists of complex pattern of 
                alternate bright and dark fringes.<br>
                8) The fringes on the hologram are very closely spaced and cannot be seen 
                by the naked eye. Hence the typical hologram appears not like a mirror 
                image.<br>
                9) (As in ordinary photo negative) but appears to be uniformly grey under 
                microscope. However, a hologram is seen to consist of myriad of small 
                dot cells and each cell contains series of fringes of various length, spacing 
                and shade.<br>
                <b>Reconstruction</b>:<br>
                1)  For viewing, a laser beam, identical to the reference beam, is used.<br>
                2) Reconstruction needs no additional lens but itself possesses the focusing 
                properties. <br>
                3) When the hologram is illuminated by the reference beam alone, light
                passing through it gets selectively transmitted or absorbed for producing 
                the original image of the object.<br>
                4) The hologram acts as a diffraction grating and secondary waves from the 
                hologram interfere constructively in certain directions and destructively in 
                other directions.<br>
                5) They form real image in front of the hologram and a virtual image behind 
                the hologram with three-dimensional effect.<br>
